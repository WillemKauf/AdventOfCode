# Advent Of Code
Solutions for Advent of Code, 2015-2021.

# Language
99% of these will be done in Python, as it is more conducive to fun.

# Scope
<del>I have completed ~80% of 2015-2021, but would like to clean them up before committing them publically.</del>

I am very happy with my progress and my updated solutions for the past years of Advent of Code, and they are now committed publically.
<del>As of March 2022, I have only a few days left of year 2021 to complete before obtaining all 350 stars!</del>

March 18, 2022. 350/350 stars. Woohoo!
